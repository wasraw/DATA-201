# DATA-201
Projects for Montgomery College DATA 201 Course

## Purpose

This Repository is a space to showcase all projects completed in my DATA 201 course, which covers data analytics with python. If you would like to also observe my journey through learning R and SQL while pursuing my Masters in Data Science, I will also have Projects and notes published on my RPubs account [here](rpubs.com/wasraw)

## Projects

- [**Project 1**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of Conneticut Real Estate Sales from 2001 to 2022 to observe housing market trends on a county, state, and national scale to see if trends align with events such as the housing market crash of 2008, and current national housing market trends. This is a deeper dive of an exploratory data analysis that I have done previous using R where I observed different metrics. My first observation of the data set can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/wasraw/1327442)
- [**Project 1 Update Link Here**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1.ipynb) : This update includes bootstrapping analysis for the data set.
- [**Project 1 Final Update Link Here**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1_finalupdate.ipynb) : This is the final updated where I modified the bootstrap simulation to observe the median instead of mean sales as requested by professor. 
- [**Project 2**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project_2.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of toyota used car sales to observe the relationship of price to other listed variables included in the data set using a linear regression model and statistical analysis. I have also included a newly engineered variable **age** which helps bring more context to the statistical analysis overall.  
- [**Project 3**](Andre_Warsaw_Project3.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of titanic survival based on simulated data that included passengers information in each row and covered whether or not a passenger survived, their age, sex, ticket class, amongst many other variables (both numerical and categorical). I performed Exploratory Data Analysis methods to help with determining what variables may have a direct impact on survival rate of a passenger before modeling using a decision tree machine learning model. The model had an 83% accuracy regarding predictions, however statistics show that it was more accurate at predicting passengers who did not survive versus those who has. Future updates are recommended to further improve the model's ability to accurately predict which passenger is able to survive and not only those who will not.
