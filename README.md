# DATA-201
Projects for Montgomery College DATA 201 Course

## Purpose

This Repository is a space to showcase all projects completed in my DATA 201 course, which covers data analytics with python. If you would like to also observe my journey through learning R and SQL while pursuing my Masters in Data Science, I will also have Projects and notes published on my RPubs account [here](rpubs.com/wasraw)

## Projects

- [**Project 1**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of Conneticut Real Estate Sales from 2001 to 2022 to observe housing market trends on a county, state, and national scale to see if trends align with events such as the housing market crash of 2008, and current national housing market trends. This is a deeper dive of an exploratory data analysis that I have done previous using R where I observed different metrics. My first observation of the data set can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/wasraw/1327442)
- [**Project 1 Update Link Here**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1.ipynb) : This update includes bootstrapping analysis for the data set.
- [**Project 1 Final Update Link Here**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1_finalupdate.ipynb) : This is the final updated where I modified the bootstrap simulation to observe the median instead of mean sales as requested by professor. 
[**Project 2**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project_2.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of toyota used car sales to observe the relationship of price to other listed variables included in the data set using a linear regression model and statistical analysis. I have also included a newly engineered variable **age** which helps bring more context to the statistical analysis overall.
