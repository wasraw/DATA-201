# DATA-201
Projects for Montgomery College DATA 201 Course

## Purpose

This Repository is a space to showcase all projects completed in my DATA 201 course, which covers data analytics with python. If you would like to also observe my journey through learning R and SQL while pursuing my Masters in Data Science, I will also have Projects and notes published on my RPubs account [here](rpubs.com/wasraw)

## Projects

- [**Project 1**](https://github.com/wasraw/DATA-201/blob/main/AndreWarsaw_Project1.ipynb) : For this project, I cover a data set of Conneticut Real Estate Sales from 2001 to 2022 to observe housing market trends on a county, state, and national scale to see if trends align with events such as the housing market crash of 2008, and current national housing market trends. This is a deeper dive of an exploratory data analysis that I have done previous using R where I observed different metrics. My first observation of the data set can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/wasraw/1327442)
